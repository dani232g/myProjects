# myProjects
Here is a sample of a few projects I have been working on throughout my journey to become a junior developer.

# Authentication portal 
A simple authentication portal I built from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootsrap. Created this to practice a bit of front end development.

# Umbrella API - VA alerts
A python script used to monitor alert users when their VAs are down (Umbrella jargon)

# Umbrella API project 
A CLI tool used to make use of the different Umbrella APIs
